# Data folder

This project now uses the pan-India master dataset for training and inference.

Place the master CSV in this folder with the filename:

```
mitti_mitra_master_dataset_all_india.csv
```

Example location after copying:

```
data/mitti_mitra_master_dataset_all_india.csv
```

Notes:
- Older `Crop_recommendation.csv` has been removed — use the master dataset instead.
- Training and inference scripts prefer the dataset in `data/` first; if not found they will fall back to `~/Downloads`.
# Data Directory

This folder should contain:
1. `training/kaggle_crop_dataset.csv`: The dataset used to train the ML models.
2. `real_world/sensor_aggregated_data.csv`: Backup of locally aggregated sensor readings.

Note: These files are not generated by the code generation script as they are binary/data assets.
